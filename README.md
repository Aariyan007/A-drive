# A-drive
A lightweight clone of Google Drive with core file management features and a simplified user interface. Built for speed, clarity, and ease of use. Upload, view, and download files seamlessly â€” without the clutter.

This project is a minimal Google Drive clone featuring a clean and simple user interface. It uses EJS templating on the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite for responsive design and UI components. User authentication is securely handled using bcrypt for password hashing and cookies for session management. User information is stored in MongoDB, while images and files are uploaded and saved using Firebase Storage. Additionally, the project incorporates smooth 3D visuals powered by Spline to enhance the user experience. It includes essential pages like registration, login, and file upload, built with Node.js and Express.js on the backend for robust API handling
